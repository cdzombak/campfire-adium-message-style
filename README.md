# cdzombak's Campfire Adium message style

Objectively the best Adium theme.

## This branch

[watsonian's original version](https://github.com/watsonian/campfire-adium-message-style) provides a clean, attractive, stolen-from-Campfire look that integrates nicely into your environment.

Atop that, [my version](https://github.com/cdzombak/campfire-adium-message-style) adds:

* a distinct style for `/me` actions
* inline image support (see below)
* this README

## Inline image support

Click a link ending in `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` or `.gif` to open the image inline, with a maximum height of 350 px. Click the image again to revert it to a link.

Shift+click the link to open it normally in your browser.

Inline movies (links ending in `.mov`) may work too, but I haven't tested it much.

This support is mostly based on code from [the ArsTechnica message style](http://adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=7338).

## Installing

[Download the latest version here](https://github.com/cdzombak/campfire-adium-message-style/zipball/master), extract that archive, and copy `Campfire.AdiumMessageStyle` into `~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Message Styles`.

(Some command like `cp -r Campfire.AdiumMessageStyle ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adium\ 2.0/Message\ Styles/` will do.)

Restart Adium. Open the preferences (hit `âŒ˜,`) and do this:
